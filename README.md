TStudent Management System is a web-based application that helps educational institutions manage their student records. This system provides a platform for students, teachers, and administrators to interact and manage data in a secure and efficient manner. In this tutorial, we will be deploying the Student Management System using MySQL, Spring Boot, React, and Node.js.. See [deployment](#deployment) for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites
Before we begin, make sure you have the following software installed on your computer:

- MySQL Server
- Spring Boot CLI
- Node.js and npm
- React

```
Set up your environment:Ensure that your development environment is properly configured for each of the technologies you'll be using. This includes installing MySQL, Node.js, and any necessary dependencies for React and Spring Boot.

Build your backend: Start by building your backend with Spring Boot and MySQL. Define your data schema, create your API endpoints, and test them to ensure they're functioning correctly.

Build your frontend: Next, build your frontend with React and Node.js. Create your components and define your UI, making sure to connect to your backend APIs.

Test locally: Test your application locally to make sure everything is working as expected. This involves running both your frontend and backend, making sure they're properly communicating with each other.

```

### Installing & Testing
Install MySQL: 
- You can download and install MySQL from the official website. Follow the instructions for your operating system to complete the installation process.

Create a database: 
- Once MySQL is installed, create a database for your student management system. You can use the MySQL command-line interface or a GUI tool like MySQL Workbench to create a new database.

Install Spring Boot: 
- You can download and install Spring Boot from the official website. Follow the instructions for your operating system to complete the installation process.

Create a Spring Boot project:
-  Create a new Spring Boot project using your favorite IDE or the Spring Boot CLI. You can use the Spring Initializr to create a basic project structure with the necessary dependencies.

Connect to MySQL: 
- Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to the MySQL database you created earlier. You can use the Spring Data JPA to handle the database connectivity.

Install Node.js: 
- You can download and install Node.js from the official website. Follow the instructions for your operating system to complete the installation process.

Install React:
-  Once Node.js is installed, you can use the Node Package Manager (npm) to install React. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command: npm install react

Create a React project: 
- Create a new React project using your favorite IDE or the Create React App CLI. You can use the npx create-react-app command to create a basic project structure with the necessary dependencies.

Connect to Spring Boot:
-  Configure your React application to connect to the Spring Boot application you created earlier. You can use the fetch API or a library like Axios to make HTTP requests to the Spring Boot REST API.

Run & Test:
-  Start both the Spring Boot and React applications and test the student management system. You can run the file as a java application to start the Spring Boot application and the npm start command to start the React application to ensure that your component is working correctly.
